4. Once on a property page or checkout page, click the Agoda Houdini extension. This will open the same property page in a new incognito window. NOTE: This will open a new incognito window every time you click the extension
5. Compare the prices on the Agoda property page in the incognito window with those in your non-incognito window.

### Troubleshooting Tips:

If the adults, rooms, or children in the occupancy options are displayed incorrectly in the incognito tab, refresh the original window before clicking the Agoda Houdini extension again.
